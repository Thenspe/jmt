                    <h1>What is Music Therapy?</h1>
                    <p>Music Therapy is a scientifically proven and allied health profession.  Musical elements and interventions such as rhythm and melody are skillfully and purposefully used by a Certified Music Therapist to address social, emotional, cognitive and, physical health. A holistic approach is used to build a therapeutic relationship enhancing the well-being and needs of the individual and to facilitate desired outcomes such as learning, self-expression, and personal growth.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Music Therapist</h2>
                    <p>In order to practice music therapy, one needs to become a Certified Music Therapist (Credentials: MTA).  This entails a four-year university bachelor degree, completing a 1,000- hour supervised clinical internship and passing a recognized certified exam which tests the knowledge of musical skills, therapy approaches, practices and techniques. Upon passing the exam the application and certification is signed through the Canadian Association of Music Therapists (CAMT).  Continuing education and following the Code of Ethics is mandatory to stay in good standing as an MTA.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Music Therapy Process</h2>
                    <p>Music Therapy sessions are designed on individualized long-term and short-term wellness goals. 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Referral or intake form</b> - An intake helps the therapist learn about the client before the first therapy session takes place. It also helps the therapist to develop interventions that are best for the client.</li>
                        <li><b>Assessment</b> - an initial assessment can take 2-4 sessions. In these sessions the music therapist will learn more about the client to establish a baseline.</li>
                        <p><b>Treatment Plan</b> - If available, the music therapist will collaborate with support team (POA, guardians, parents, staff, other disciplines) to individualize the objectives and goals for the client. During treatment musical interventions such as singing, songwriting, improvisation, listening, lyrical analysis, breath work etc.., may be used to address goals. </p>
                        <li><b>Review</b> - After a recommended period, the music therapist will review and reassess to determine if goals and objectives need to be modified or have been achieved. Once goals have been achieved a recommendation of being discharged will be discussed. </li>
                    </ol>
